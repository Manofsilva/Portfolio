# Portfolio

 - This is my web application that serves as my personal portfolio to demonstrate my skills and projects completed as a Full Stack Web Developer.
 - These skills were garnered during my during and after my time in the University of Washington Bootcamp.
 
 ### Tech

This web application uses a number of resources and technology to work properly:

* [HTML] - the bulk of the porfolio is off basic HTML
* [CSS] - several helpful styling option including media queries
* [Javascript] - this was needed in order to make sure that some elements were able to scroll into view
* [MaterializeCSS] - for some helpful animation tools
